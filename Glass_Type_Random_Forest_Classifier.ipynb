        "Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that aggregates the predictions of multiple individual decision trees to make a final classification prediction. By combining the predictions of multiple trees, the Random Forest Classifier aims to achieve higher accuracy and improved generalization compared to using a single decision tree. Random Forest Classifier is built upon decision trees, which are hierarchical structures that recursively partition the input data based on features until reaching leaf nodes, where class labels are assigned. Each decision tree in the Random Forest independently learns to make predictions based on different subsets of the training data."
